# Student Portal

* I have designed a little application that calculates the letter grade of the specified numerical grade.
* It returns "You Fail" if the letter grade is calculated as F, and returns "You Pass" in other conditions.
* If the student is passing the lecture, the output text gets printed in green.
* If the student is failing the lecturei then the output text gets printed in red.
