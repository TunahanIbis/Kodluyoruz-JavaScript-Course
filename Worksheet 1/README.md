<b>I have designed a little application that calculates the letter grade of the specified numeric grade.</b>

## Details
* First of all, here are the corresponding letters of numeric grades:

  90-100 --> AA
  
  85-90 --> BA
  
  80-85 --> BB
  
  75-80 --> CB
  
  70-75 --> CC
  
  65-70 --> DC
  
  60-65 --> DD
  
  50-60 --> FD
  
  0-50 --> FF
  
<br>

* It returns "<b>You Pass</b>" if the letter grade is not calculated as FF.

* In this condition, the output text gets printed in green.

<br>

* It returns "<b>You Fail</b>" if the letter grade is FF.
  
* In this condition, the output text gets printed in red.
