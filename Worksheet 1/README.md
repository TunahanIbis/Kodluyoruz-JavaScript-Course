# Student Portal

<b>I have designed a little application that calculates the letter grade of the specified numerical grade.</b>

## Details
* It returns "<b>You Pass</b>" if the letter grade is not calculated as F.
* If the student is passing the lecture, the output text gets printed in green.

* It returns "<b>You Fail</b>" if the letter grade is F.
* If the student is failing the lecturei then the output text gets printed in red.
